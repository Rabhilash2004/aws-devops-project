AWS DevOps  Project using CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code)

AWS DevOps Mini Project – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This project demonstrates automated cloud infrastructure provisioning using AWS CloudFormation, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

Instead of manually creating resources through the AWS Management Console, the entire infrastructure was defined using YAML templates and deployed programmatically. The CloudFormation stack provisions a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnet, security group rules, and an Amazon EC2 instance. After deployment, the server was accessed securely via SSH and Apache was installed to host a live web application.

This hands-on project reflects a real-world DevOps workflow — infrastructure design, automation, validation, and application delivery using cloud-native tools.
